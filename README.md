## üß† What I Learned

This project was built after watching a lesson from [Angela Yu‚Äôs 100 Days of Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) ‚Äî but I didn‚Äôt just copy-paste! I challenged myself to write it again **from memory**, using what I learned üí™

Along the way, I practiced:
- Input/output handling
- Type conversions (`int`, `float`)
- Conditional logic
- Exception handling in Python

---

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Install Python (version 3.x recommended)
2. Open your Python editor (Thonny, VS Code, etc.)
3. Copy the code from `bill_splitter.py`
4. Run and enjoy!

## üìÅ Files

- `bill_splitter.py` ‚Äì The main program file with all the logic
- `README.md` ‚Äì You‚Äôre reading it üòâ
